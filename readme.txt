- Gameplay

Galaga puts the player in control of a spacecraft which is situated at the bottom of the screen, with enemy aliens arriving in formation from the top of the screen, trying to collide with the player. The spacecraft can only move left and right and shoot at the enemies. The game ends when the player's last life is lost by colliding with an enemy, or when all the enemies are defeated.
